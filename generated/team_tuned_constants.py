    # TUNING GUIDE FOR FOC MODE:
    #
    # PRE-REQUISITE:
    #   To use Tuner X Control Tab without interference, the robot code must NOT
    #   be commanding the motors.
    #
    #   Deploy an empty project (or comment out `self.manuallyDrive()` in robot.py).
    # PHOENIX TUNER X INSTRUCTIONS:
    # 1. Open Phoenix Tuner X and connect to the robot.
    # 2. Select one of the Steer motors (e.g., "Front Left Steer").
    # 3. Go to the "Control" tab.
    #    - Control Mode: Position TorqueCurrentFOC
    #    - Gains: Slot 0
    # 4. Go to the "Plot" tab (or "Graph").
    #    - Add Signals: Position, ClosedLoopTarget, ClosedLoopError, StatorCurrent.
    # 5. Enable the robot (Driver Station Enabled).
    #
    # TUNING STEPS:
    #
    # kS (Static Friction Feedforward) - Amps to overcome friction
    #   - Test: In Control tab, set Control Mode to "TorqueCurrentFOC".
    #     Slowly increase the main control slider (labeled "Output" or "Current") until the wheel just starts to move.
    #     That current value is your kS.
    #   - Start: 0.0 Amps | Increment: 0.05 Amps | Typical range: 0.1 - 0.5 Amps
    #
    # kV (Velocity Feedforward) - DERIVED from motor specs, usually no tuning needed
    #   - Derived as: (stall_current / free_speed) * gear_ratio
    #   - If actual velocity consistently undershoots/overshoots target, adjust ±10%
    #
    # kP (Proportional Gain) - Amps per rotation of error
    #   - Test: Set Control Mode back to "Position TorqueCurrentFOC".
    #     Change the "Position" slider abruptly (step response).
    #     Watch the "Position" graph chase the "ClosedLoopTarget".
    #   - Goal: Fast response with minimal overshoot.
    #   - Start: 0.0 Amps/rot | Increment: 10 Amps/rot | Typical range: 30 - 150 Amps/rot
    #
    # kD (Derivative Gain) - Amps per RPS of error change
    #   - Test: Same as kP. If the wheel oscillates (wobbles) when reaching target, add kD.
    #   - Start: 0.0 Amps/RPS | Increment: 0.1 Amps/RPS | Typical range: 0.2 - 2.0 Amps/RPS
    #
    # kI (Integral Gain) - Avoid unless absolutely necessary
    #   - Only use if there's persistent steady-state error after tuning kP/kD/kS.
    #   - Start: 0 | If needed: 0.1 | Typical: 0 (not recommended for steering)
    #
    # kA (Acceleration Feedforward) - Amps per RPS² - usually leave at 0
    #   - Only tune if you need very aggressive acceleration profiles

    #     Set Velocity slider to 50% of max speed.
    #     If "Velocity" is consistently below "ClosedLoopTarget", increase kV.
    #     If above, decrease kV.
