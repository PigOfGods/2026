"""Example Choreo autonomous modes.

These are example implementations showing how to use the ChoreoAuto base class.
Copy and modify these for your own autonomous routines!

To create a new Choreo auto:
1. Design your path in the Choreo GUI (https://choreo.autos)
2. Save the trajectory to deploy/choreo/your_trajectory.traj
3. Create a new class that extends ChoreoAuto
4. Set MODE_NAME, TRAJECTORY_NAME, and DISABLED = False
5. Optionally override on_trajectory_start() and on_trajectory_end()

    1. Open Choreo and create a path called "simple_path"
